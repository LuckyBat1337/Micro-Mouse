# Micro-Mouse
Micro mouse project for school

ZZ = things that are needed for review, ZZ chosen as there is not a need for any function to be called ZZ and ZZ is easily able to be looked up in a document by "Ctrl + F".

Standard for how the code should look is as follows:

For good practice no namespace will be used unless it is a local namespace created internally for the project.

For variables with one word keep it uncapitalized for the entirety (e.g. move() ).

For variables with two or more words keep it uncapitalized on the first word, then without spaces capitalize the second so on (e.g. moveRight() or turnLeftOnWallRight() ).

indentation style follows standard procedure for c++ being function name, bracket, new line, code, new line, bracket. (e.g. main(){
}            ).
